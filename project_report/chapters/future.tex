The immediate future prospect of the project done on control system design of advanced robotic systems is to deploy the LQR control algorithm experimentally on the quadrotor and verify its response against the simulations. \\

Further, more prospects include the testing and experimental verification of more such type of control algorithms.\\

As one for the future, A reinforcement learning approach can be taken to stabilize a quad without using any pre-defined control algorithm.
