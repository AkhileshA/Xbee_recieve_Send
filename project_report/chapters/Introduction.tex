Determination of health of an induction motor is a growing technology in todayâ€™s world. Using Artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms can automate the process of fault detection in an induction motor. The feature extraction of data which is being obtained in real time from machine can be used to determine the state of machine. This data is transmited from the motor to the ground station for the fault detection and give feedback to the motor controller if necessary
